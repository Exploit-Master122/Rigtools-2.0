*THIS ONLY WORKS FOR CHROMEBOOK,NO WINDOWS OR ANYTHING***
 ***THE ULTIMATE RIGTOOLS GUIDE***
**Rigtools** is an exploit that allows users to run code on extensions, disable extensions, and basically do whatever they want with an extension as long as it has the correct permissions.***IT IS PATCHED ON ALL CHROME VERSIONS 133 AND HIGHER*** =-( But not anymore,'cause I unpatched it! (wink)😧

### How do you use it?

1. Open this link and just leave it alone. (Note: This will not run code it's just there to fix the second page.)
```md
devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html
```
2. Open this link and go to Network.

```md
devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/
```
3. Double-Click the black/grey box:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ae4b07-d3f3-4318-9d63-404b9142e4f0)

4.Wait for a bit...It should open a page that has a lot of red and purple buttons.
***TIP*** If it does not,(One of the problems when this exploit got patched)
Then ***RIGHT CLICK THE GREY BOX*** and select "Open URL"

5. Click on the button named "Gforms Locked mode".

6.Behold:RIGTOOLS!!! You can disable extensions that you want. (A reminder,These may stop working after a few weeks,you might have to do it again.)

7. Finally,you can run code like "Hello World" or something like that through the extensions.

8.Go to 
```md
https://devtoolbypass.playcode.io/
```
Click "skip intro" and drag the button.
This is a hyperlink to rigtools.(BWAHAHAHAH)

-They may make your computer a bit laggy,but nothing much,just some distortion of the mouse or something.
-If using a vpn,do not try and test or experiment around with this using "Metasploit" or any "Penetration testing" platforms.
Be careful.That stuff can break your computers.BEWARE OF BROWSERS! 🙂 
If you know what I mean...😏
There is a **real** second version,though.
When you get to the original version,
-Scroll down a bit,until you find a button named "Update Rigtools".Click it.
-After,go to 
```
rigtools.playcode.io
```
and that should work too,as a substitute version.
***If it does not work,drag the "filesystem" url into your bookmarks bar and spam click it!!***

***NEW "BLOAT" EXPLOIT***
```
filesystem:chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/persistent/bloat.html
```
If you drag this into a new tab,it will probably close immediately.
If it doesn't close and you get a cool-looking tab with a smiley
emoticon and the words saying "#disabling... Happy days without blocking am I right"?
Then all you have to do is wait a few minutes and the code is handed you you on
a sliver platter! 🤤

It it does close,then figure out what Control+Shift+T does
or search it up (It closes recently opened tabs)
and open that tab (and,like usual,it will frustratingly 
close by itself)...And ***SPAM*** Control+Shift+T.
It should work! =-)

***IF YOU ONLY WANT THE DEVELOPER TOOLS,AND NO UNBLOCKER,THEN USE THIS:***
```
filesystem:chrome-extension://mloajfnmjckfjbeeofcdaecbelnblden/temporary/index.html
```
This will only show the Javascript playground with the coding peice for people who know what they are doing and not the disable extensions part. =-P


One more thing,that relates to this project:
***IF GITHUB GETS BLOCKED,USE THIS***
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exploit-Master12/RigTools-2.0/01790b954fd7bd2d0b701848e0b6e82197a05713/README.md
```

***RANDOM PRANK*** (DO NOT GO TO THESE LINKS BWHAHAHAHAH)
Really good proxy by Blobby-Boi **XD**
```
https://blobby-boi.github.io/RammerheadPR0XY/
```
Amazing exploit that is so much better than rigtools by me. **>=-)**
```
https://killchrome.playcode.io/
```

For now,this will do...

And now you can do whatever you want on your computer.Use this wisely,and stay on task in class...At lunch,you could be hangin' out in the library with your friends playing bloxd.io or whatever... =-D 🙂 

***MORE STUFF COMING SOON***
-Follow for more exploits,Exploit-Master12 =-)
